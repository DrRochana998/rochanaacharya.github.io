excerpt: "According to the WHO, more than two-thirds of all antibiotics are used in the community, of which about 30% are used inappropriately. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) problem is a growing threat to Nepal because of indiscriminate and inappropriate use. However, exact data on the extent of inappropriate use of antibiotics in the community is scarce in Nepal."
